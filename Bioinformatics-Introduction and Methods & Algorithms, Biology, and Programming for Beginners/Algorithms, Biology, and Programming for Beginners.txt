The course will be based around the following biological questions, with the algorithmic ideas that we will use to solve them in parentheses:

 Where Does DNA Replication Begin? (Algorithmic Warm-up)

 How Do We Sequence Antibiotics? (Brute Force Algorithms)

 Which DNA Patterns Act As Cellular Clocks? (Greedy and Randomized Algorithms)

 How Do We Assemble Genomes? (Graph Algorithms)

 How Do We Compare Biological Sequences? (Dynamic Programming Algorithms)

 Are There Fragile Regions in the Human Genome? (Combinatorial Algorithms)

 Which Animal Gave Us SARS? (Evolutionary Trees)

 How Do We Locate Disease-Causing Mutations? (Combinatorial Pattern Matching)

 How Did Yeast Become Such a Good Wine Brewer? (Clustering Algorithms)

Some of these topics will require you to complete coding challenges in order to implement bioinformatics algorithms, followed by a comprehension quiz at the end of the topic.  Other topics will carry lighter workloads and consist primarily of lecture videos and short quizzes.

# Learning From Data - Solutions

This is the code/math I wrote in order to solve most of the assignments of
[Learning From Data](https://www.edx.org/course/caltechx/cs1156x/learning-data/1120),
a machine learning course by Caltech.

**Disclaimer:** Don't follow this material blindly, it might be wrong. Use
your judgement.

### A Note About The Honor Code

The solutions were released incrementally, one assignment at a time, after
each deadline. According to the course staff, this is ok; in fact, the
professor himself encourages the students to show their solutions.

To fully enjoy the course, do not look at the solutions provided here until you
submit your answer.

## Requirements

* [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) 3.6+
* [LIBSVM](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) 3.17

## How The Assignments Are Organized

Solutions for each week's homework are kept in its own directory. Each directory
contains a `README` file that explains the main purpose of the homework along
with the following subdirectories:

<dl>
  <dt>/img</dt>
  <dd>Figures and plots generated during my thinking process</dd>
  <dt>/math</dt>
  <dd>Explanations and solutions involving math</dd>
  <dt>/src</dt>
  <dd>Octave code that answers the more practical questions</dd>
</dl>

# Week #1

The main aspect of this homework is the implementation of a simple model called
Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA).

There's also code to answer a few other questions about probability.

## Plots

This is a sample plot that shows the difference between the target function
![f][f] in magenta and the hypothesis ![g][g] in green found via PLA on
![N=100][n100] points uniformly distributed in ![between -1 and 1][interval].

First, we know that the probability of picking a red marble is
$P(R) = 0.55$, and that its complement is given by
$P(\neg R) = 1 - P(R) = 0.45$.

So the probability of a sample of size $N$ with no red marbles is

\begin{equation*}
P(A) = P(\neg R)^N = 0.45^{10}
\end{equation*}

The probability that a single sample has at least one red marble is the
complement of the probability that a single sample has no red marbles:

\begin{equation*}
P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.45^{10}
\end{equation*}

Finally, the probability of at least one of the samples have no red marbles is
the complement of the probability that at least one of the samples has at least
one red marble:

\begin{equation*}
1 - P(\neg A)^{1000} = 1 - (1 - 0.45^{10})^{1000} \approx 0.289
\end{equation*}

# Questions #6-8

In the lectures, we study the *positive interval*  model whose break point is
![k=3][k3]. This can be verifyed by writing down a truth table with three
points and seeing that one of the dichotomies can't be realized by ![H][H].

The same method can be used to solve for the *2-intervals model*, and you can
verify that its breakpoint is ![k=5][k5].

With that information in hand, it's easy to see that the growth function for
the general *M-intervals* model is

![growth function](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbinom%7BN%2B1%7D%7B4%7D%2B%5Cbinom%7BN%2B1%7D%7B2%7D%2B1%2C)

and its breakpoint is ![k=2M+1][bp].

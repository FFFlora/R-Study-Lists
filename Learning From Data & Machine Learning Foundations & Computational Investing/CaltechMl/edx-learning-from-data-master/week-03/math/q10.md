# Question #10

By taking a closer look at the given hypothesis set ![H][H]

![Hypothesis set](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a%5E2%20%5Cleq%20x_1%5E2%2Bx_2%5E2%20%5Cleq%20b%5E2%2C)

one can assume that our model has two parameters, which are the radii ![a][a]
and ![b][b], and that those circles are concentric in the origin; if that was
not the case, we would have at least two more parameters to indicate where the
center of both circles would be in the plane.

Yet another limiting factor is that the form ![x1^2+x2^2][x12x22] is very
restricting in the sense of the number of dichotomies it can realize. One
example is that both points ![e1][e1] and ![e2][e2] yield the same result so,
in a way, it's like using two real numbers to represent just one positive real
number, which is the distance between some point and the origin.

From this perspective, one can see the striking similarity between this model
and the *one-interval* learning model.

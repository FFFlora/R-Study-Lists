# Question #4

If we look at both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional *perceptrons*, the following
growth function seems to hold:

![MH(N)=d+1](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_%5Cmathcal%7BH%7D%28N%29%3Dd%2B1)

I don't know how to prove it though. So, if that's the case, by definition, the
breakpoint is one point beyond the maximum number of points that can be
shattered this ![H][H] (a ![d][d]-dimensional *perceptron*), thus the solution
is ![d+2][d2].

\textbf{Disclaimer.} This is the reasoning I used to solve the problem; it
may be wrong though. This is intended just as food for thought.

\section{Regularization With Polynomials}

This question asks about a hypothesis set based on the Legendre polynomial
$L_{10}(x)$:

\begin{equation*}
L_{10}(x) = \frac{1}{256}(46189x^{10} - 109395x^8 + 90090x^6 - 30030x^4 + 3465x^2 - 63)
\end{equation*}

The regularization parameter $C$ can be either 0 or 1; when $C=0$, all terms
in the polynomial with degree $d \geq Q_o$ are cancelled.

\subsection{The Answer}

The correct answer to this question can be found just by proving the first
option wrong.

The first option, $\mathcal{H}(10,0,3) \cup \mathcal{H}(10,0,4) = \mathcal{H}_4$,
is incorrect because the regularization on both $\mathcal{H}(10,0,3)$ and
$\mathcal{H}(10,0,4)$ ommits the same terms on the polynomial, resulting in

\begin{equation*}
L_{10}'(x) = \frac{1}{256}(3465x^2 - 63),
\end{equation*}

so the union $\mathcal{H}(10,0,3) \cup \mathcal{H}(10,0,4)$ cannot possibly be
$\mathcal{H}_4$. However, it's plausible that the intersection
$\mathcal{H}(10,0,3) \cap \mathcal{H}(10,0,4)$ might be $\mathcal{H}_2$.

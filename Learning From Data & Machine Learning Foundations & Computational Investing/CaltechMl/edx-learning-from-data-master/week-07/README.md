# Week 07

This week's homework was mostly about practical exercises regarding validation,
cross-validation (leave-one-out) and SVMs (dual form).

## Plots

The last three questions proposed an experiment so we can compare the
performance of hard-margin SVMs against PLA.

I made this next figure so I could validate my implementation. Here, the green
decision boundary was found via PLA, and the other one was found via SVM. The
points that represent the support vectors are also highlighted.
